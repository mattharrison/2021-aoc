* Day 1
** Errors
*** ValueError - Trailing value on input (off by one?) Resolution - Strip data
*** ValueError - Creating doctest and didn't make raw (find_increase_window)
*** RuntimeError - Using while loop in window_iter instead of for loop
*** Pandas read_csv - didn't make names a list
* Day 2
** Errors
*** AttributeError - Tried to call doctest.main (instead of testmod)
*** Depth is positive (I was treating as negative). Need to flip -
*** Pandas - read in first line as headers (use names)
*** Miscalculated pandas aim 
*** Used np.where instead of np.select
*** Lambda syntax error used . instead of :
* Day 3
** Errors
*** TypeError used Counter expecting value to be string instead of int
*** SyntaxError closing paren mismatch
*** TypeError > with function and list - forgot "key" for max function
*** Logic error list comprehension not working - change to for loop
*** SyntaxError closing paren mismatch (complicated key function)
*** Logic error solved, was using max([0,1] instead of max(['0', '1']
*** IndentationError copied code but not while loop
*** Logic error trying to sum where line[bit_pos] == 1 instead of line[bit_pos] == '1' 
*** Logic error finding least common. Changed logic and tested
* Day 4
** Errors
*** Typo - forgot trailing quote in docstring
*** Logic - When parsing I didn't split out elements in line
    boards = [lines[i:i+5] for i in range(2, len(lines), 6)]
*** Logic - Didn't convert strings to nums in data
*** Typo - list comp. forgot "for"
*** Logic - tried to cast list to int instead of items in list
*** Syntax - while not done:=False: needs parens
*** Off by n error -    num, *nums = nums exhausting
*** Syntax error setting conditional breakpoint Correct below: b line, exp
    b 88, num == 24
*** Syntax error - tried to use walrus with while loop,     while not (done:=False):
    Kept setting done to false
*** Downloaded wrong file... 
*** Logic error - max_index needed >= instead of >
*** Logic error - exhausted nums in part2 instead of removing boards when finished
*** Python error - looping over list (boards) and changing it
    Solution track finished and filter in loop
*** Logic error - part two wasn't tracking val
*** Typo - board_finish_index
*** Too many solutions need to wait
*** Part2 works on sample data but not real data
*** Convert to OO - Easy to work
* Day 5
** Errors
*** Logic error parsing data (forgot ,)
*** Error Sample got 2 instead of 5 (parsing error split src twice)
    Copy/paste error - forgot to change part of pasted
*** Logic error - summing count in values, rather than number of points
*** Type error - trying to get len of generator
*** Part2 enum_pts_in_line doesn't handle diagonal
*** Logic error - Created enum_pts then got 7 points instead of 12 for sample
    enum_pts countdown was backwards
*** Logic eror - enum_pts_in_line for diagonal put x,y in one call rather that x1,x2
* Day 6
** Errors
*** Part 1 w/ no issues
*** Part 2 started to run but I killed it
*** Incubation! - Track days to counts instead of individual fishes
*** RuntimeError - Looping over days added 8 and 7 need to seed those with 0
*** RuntimeError - Also need to seed 0 (and others w/ sample) - use set_default
*** typo - wrong variable in for loop (could be caught by editor)
*** typo - setdefaults (could be caught by editor)
*** Logic error - set next day value with addition rather than replacing
    Also loop over day nums from 7 to 0
*** typo - forgot in in range
*** Logic error - bubbled sum down - increase count from 0 to 8
*** Logic error - don't mutate dict, make new dict
*** Logic error - don't mutate dict, forgot to clear out new dict
*** Typo - Ran part two against sample data not real data
